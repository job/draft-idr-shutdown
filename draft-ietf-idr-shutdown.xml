                "Administrative Shutdown" subcode for operators to transmit a

                It can be troublesome for an operator to correlate a
                <xref target="RFC4271">BGP-4</xref>
                session teardown in the network with a notice that was
                transmitted via off-line methods such email or telephone calls.
                This document specifies a mechanism to transmit a short
                freeform <xref target="RFC3629">UTF-8</xref> message as part of
                a <xref target="RFC4486">Cease NOTIFICATION message</xref> to
                inform the peer why the BGP session is being shutdown.

                If a BGP speaker decides to terminate its session with a BGP
                neighbor, then the BGP speaker MAY send to the neighbor a
                NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code "Cease" and the Error
                Subcode "Administrative Shutdown" followed by a length field
                and an UTF-8 encoded string. The contents of the string
                are at the operator's discretion.

The Cease NOTIFICATION message with an Administrative Shutdown Communication is
encoded as below:

        <section anchor="ops" title="Operational Considerations">
            <t>
                Operators are encouraged to use the Shutdown Communication to
                inform their peers of the reason for the shutdown of the BGP
                session and include out-of-band reference materials.  An
                example of a useful Shutdown Communication would be:
            </t>
            <t>"[TICKET-1-1438367390] software upgrade, back in 2 hours"</t>
            <t>
                "[TICKET-1-1438367390]" is a ticket reference with significance
                to both the sender and receiver, followed by a brief human
                readable message regarding the reason for the BGP session
                shutdown followed by an indication about the length of the
                maintenance. The receiver can now use the string
                'TICKET-1-1438367390' to search in their email archive to find
                more details.

        <section anchor="error" title="Error Handling">
            <t>
                Any erroneous or malformed Shutdown Communication received
                SHOULD be logged for the attention of the operator and then MAY
                be discarded.

        <section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
            <t>
                Per this document, IANA is requested to reference this document
                at subcode "Administrative Shutdown" in the "Cease NOTIFICATION
                message subcodes" registry under the "Border Gateway Protocol
                (BGP) Parameters" group in addition to <xref target="RFC4486" />.

        <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
                This document uses UTF-8 encoding for the Shutdown
                Communication. There are a number of security issues with
                UNICODE. Implementers and operator are advised to review
                <xref target="UTR36">UNICODE TR36</xref> to learn about these
                issues. This document guards against the technical issues
                outlined in UTR36 by REQUIRING "shortest form" encoding.
                However, the visual spoofing due to character confusion still
                persists. This specification minimizes the effects of visual
                spoofing by limiting the length of the Shutdown
                Communication.
            </t>
            <t>
                Users of this mechanism should be aware that unless a
                transport that provides integrity (such as <xref
                target="RFC5925">TCP-AO</xref>) is used for the BGP
                session in question, a Shutdown Communication message
                could be forged. Unless a transport that provides
                confidentiality (such as <xref
                target="RFC4303">IPSec</xref>) is used, a Shutdown
                Communication message could be snooped by an attacker.
                These issues are common to any BGP message but may be of
                greater interest in the context of this proposal since
                the information carried in the message is generally
                expected to be used for human-to-human communication.

  <section title="Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION">
       <t>
           This section records the status of known implementations of the
           protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of
           this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in
           RFC7942. The description of implementations in this
           section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in
           progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any
           individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the
           IETF. Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the
           information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
           This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog
           of available implementations or their features. Readers are advised
           to note that other implementations may exist.

           As of today these vendors have produced an implementation of the
