                "Administrative Shutdown" and "Administrative Reset" subcodes

                It can be troublesome for an operator to correlate a <xref target="RFC4271">BGP-4</xref> session teardown in the network with a notice that was transmitted via off-line methods such email or telephone calls.
                This document updates <xref target="RFC4486" /> by specifying a mechanism to transmit a short freeform <xref target="RFC3629">UTF-8</xref> message as part of a <xref target="RFC4271">Cease NOTIFICATION message</xref> to inform the peer why the BGP session is being shutdown or reset.

        <section anchor="message" title="Shutdown Communication">
            <t>
                If a BGP speaker decides to terminate its session with a BGP neighbor, and it sends a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code "Cease" and Error Subcode "Administrative Shutdown" or "Administrative Reset" <xref target="RFC4486" />, it MAY include an UTF-8 encoded string.
                The contents of the string are at the operator's discretion.

The Cease NOTIFICATION message with a Shutdown Communication is encoded as

        <section anchor="ops" title="Operational Considerations">
            <t>
                Operators are encouraged to use the Shutdown Communication to
                inform their peers of the reason for the shutdown of the BGP
                session and include out-of-band reference materials.  An
                example of a useful Shutdown Communication would be:
            </t>
            <t>"[TICKET-1-1438367390] software upgrade, back in 2 hours"</t>
            <t>
                "[TICKET-1-1438367390]" is a ticket reference with significance
                to both the sender and receiver, followed by a brief human
                readable message regarding the reason for the BGP session
                shutdown followed by an indication about the length of the
                maintenance. The receiver can now use the string
                'TICKET-1-1438367390' to search in their email archive to find
                more details.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="error" title="Error Handling">
            <t>
                If a Shutdown Communication with an invalid Length value, or an invalid UTF-8 sequence is received, a message indicating this event SHOULD be logged for the attention of the operator.
                An erroneous or malformed Shutdown Communication itself MAY be logged in a hexdump format.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
            <t>
                Per this document, IANA is requested to reference this document
                at subcode "Administrative Shutdown", and at subcode
                "Administrative Reset" in the "Cease NOTIFICATION message
                subcodes" registry under the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
                Parameters" group in addition to <xref target="RFC4486" />.

        </section>

        <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
                This document uses UTF-8 encoding for the Shutdown Communication.
                There are a number of security issues with UNICODE.
                Implementers and operator are advised to review <xref target="UTR36">UNICODE TR36</xref> to learn about these issues.
                UTF-8 "Shortest Form" encoding is REQUIRED to guard against the technical issues outlined in UTR36.
                However, the visual spoofing due to character confusion still persists.
                This specification minimizes the effects of visual spoofing by limiting the length of the Shutdown Communication.
            </t>
            <t>
                Users of this mechanism should be aware that unless a transport that provides integrity is used for the BGP session in question, a Shutdown Communication message could be forged.
                Unless a transport that provides confidentiality is used, a Shutdown Communication message could be snooped by an attacker.
                These issues are common to any BGP message but may be of greater interest in the context of this proposal since the information carried in the message is generally expected to be used for human-to-human communication.
                Refer to the related considerations in <xref target="RFC4271" /> and <xref target="RFC4272" />.
            </t> 
            <t>
                Users of this mechanism should consider applying data minimization practises as outlined in <xref target="RFC6973">Section 6.1</xref> as a received Shutdown Communication may be used at the receiver's discretion.

  <section title="Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION">
       <t>
           This section records the status of known implementations of the
           protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of
           this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in
           RFC7942. The description of implementations in this
           section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in
           progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any
           individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the
           IETF. Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the
           information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
           This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog
           of available implementations or their features. Readers are advised
           to note that other implementations may exist.
       </t>
       <t>
           As of today these vendors have produced an implementation of the
           Shutdown Communication:
