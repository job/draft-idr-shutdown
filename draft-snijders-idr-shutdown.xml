            <t>
                It can be troublesome for an operator to correlate a
                <xref target="RFC4271">BGP-4</xref>
                session teardown in the network with a notice that was
                transmitted via off-line methods such email or telephone calls.
                This document specifies a mechanism to transmit a short
                freeform <xref target="RFC3629">UTF-8</xref> message as part of
                a <xref target="RFC4486">Cease NOTIFICATION message</xref> to
                inform the peer why the BGP session is being shutdown.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="message" title="Shutdown Communication">
            <t>
                If a BGP speaker decides to terminate its session with a BGP
                neighbor, then the BGP speaker MAY send to the neighbor a
                NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code "Cease" and the Error
                Subcode TBD "Shutdown Communication" followed by a freeform
                UTF-8 encoded string with a REQUIRED maximum length of 128
                octets. The contents of the string are at the operator's
                discretion.
            </t>
<t>
The Shutdown Communication Cease NOTIFICATION message is encoded as following:

</t>
            <t>
                To support international characters, the Shutdown Communication
                field MUST be encoded using UTF-8.
            </t>
            <t>
                The sending BGP speaker SHOULD avoid octet values below 32
                (control characters), however these values are legal.
                Following <xref target="UTR36">UNICODE TR36</xref>, Sec 3.1,
                the sending BGP speaker MUST encode messages in the "shortest
                form" and MUST NOT interpret messages in the "non shortest
                form".  A receiving BGP speaker MUST NOT interpret invalid
                UTF-8 sequences.
            </t>
            <t>
                It is RECOMMENDED that a BGP speaker receiving a Shutdown
                Communication observe retry behaviour in line with the
                <xref target="RFC4486">RFC4486</xref> behaviour for
                "Administrative Shutdown" (sec 4.0).
            </t>
            <t>
                Mechanisms concerning the reporting of information contained in
                the Shutdown Communication are implementation specific but
                SHOULD include methods such as <xref target="RFC5424">SYSLOG</xref>.

        <section anchor="ops" title="Operational Considerations">
            <t>
                Operators are encouraged to use the Shutdown Communication to
                inform their peers with a reference and reason as to why the
                BGP session is shut down. An example of a useful Shutdown
                Communication would be:
            </t>
            <t>"[VNOC-1-1438367390] software upgrade, back in 2 hours"</t>
            <t>
                "[VNOC-1-1438367390]" is a ticket reference with significance
                to both the sender and receiver, followed by a brief human
                readable message regarding the work triggering the BGP session
                shutdown followed by an indication about the length of the
                maintenance. The receiver can now use the string
                'VNOC-1-1438367390' to search in their email archive to find
                more details.
            </t>
        </section>

	<section anchor="error" title="Error Handling">
            <t>
		Any erroneous or malformed Shutdown Communication received SHOULD 
		be logged for the attention of the operator and then MAY be 
		discarded.
            </t>

        <section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
            <t>
                Per this document, IANA is requested to assign a subcode named
                "Shutdown Communication" in the "Cease NOTIFICATION message
                subcodes" registry under the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
                Parameters" group.
            </t>

        <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
                This document uses UTF-8 encoding for the Shutdown
                Communication. There are a number of security issues with
                UNICODE. Any implementer and operator is advised to review
                <xref target="UTR36">UNICODE TR36</xref> to learn about these
                issues. This document guards against the technical issues
                outlined in UTR36 by REQUIRING "shortest form" encoding.
                However, the visual spoofing due to character confusion still
                persists. This document tries to minimize the effects of visual
                spoofing by allowing UNICODE only where local script is
                expected and needed, and by limiting the length of the Shutdown
                Communication.

  <section title="Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION">
       <t>
           This section records the status of known implementations of the
           protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of
           this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in
           <xref target="RFC7942" />. The description of implementations in this
           section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in
           progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any
           individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the
           IETF. Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the
           information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
           This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog
           of available implementations or their features. Readers are advised
           to note that other implementations may exist.
       </t>
       <t>
           As of today these vendors have produced an implementation of the
           Shutdown Communication:
